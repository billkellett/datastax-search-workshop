# datastax-search-workshop

This is a 3-hour introductory workshop on DataStax Enterprise Search.

### Motivation

Search is a key DSE capability that differentiates DataStax from competitors.  However, prospects often do not understand the capabilities of DSE Search, and do not know how to use it.  

This workshop helps prospects become familiar with DSE Search.  We take a "practitioner" approach, with minimal focus on internals.

### What is included?

Studio notebooks, a pre-populated keyspace, and a corresponding presentation (with detailed speaker notes) walk the students through the most important capabilities of DSE Search for database-centric applications.

* Basic Search indexes
* Full-text search
* Facets
* GeoSpatial search

### Business Take Aways

DSE Search adds a crucial capability that is especially important to Business Analysts, Customer Service Representatives, and other stakeholders to often need to do ad hoc queries against a database.  

### Technical Take Aways

DSE Search adds a crucial capability that is not found in open-source Cassandra.
